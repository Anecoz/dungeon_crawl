2D turn based dungeon crawler with random enemies

- Implement scene changes, i.e. moving from room to room
- Randomly spawn enemies
- Make a movement system (or similar) that takes a "pending" movement, or velocity, and adds to pos. instead of spreading out posComp += everywhere
- Armour and stats that affect damage
- Make it clear in GUI that player is in combat, i.e. flashing red "COMBAT" sign or w/e, also "Your turn!"
- Write "Enemy used <ability>" and "You used <ability>" in GUI when an ability is used, maybe also how much damage it did if possible?
- Hover over abilities should show the name of ability + AP cost and damage
